# EXOGO

The goal of this project was to use React, Redux, Router, and Asynchronous Javascript to deliver a unique product for am audience which helps them in some way. Using NASA's and Caltech's exoplanet API, I created a site for space nerds to easily sort through exoplanets that would be most enjoyable to live in. Want to experience half the gravity as Earth? There is a planet for you! Want to go from being 40 to 20? Pick a planet with twice the orbital period as Earth! 

I solidified an understanding of React and Redux as well as testing different ways to Route components or containers. Most of my difficulties arose from using the materials ui to incorporate fancy components. Extensive testing and documentation was needed to understand how to pull values and style material ui inputs.
